##Experimental setup
Threads = 8. <br>
Benchmark without logging, binary with logging.<br>
Random vector setup in all runs of benchmark and bin. Time for vector generation is not included. <br>
Vector size = 4 million. <br>
Policy block size = 1000. <br>
Running on dahu-8 for log.
Running on dahu-15 for benchmark.

##Conclusions
Difference in par split times could be because of distribution of par split times. Mean and median could be that far apart.
