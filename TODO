- new scheduling algorithm splitting recursively for locality
- stabilize api (do we need a 'split_at' ? rename Block to Input ? rename compute to work ?)
   it was nice to only need split (for .chars iterators for example)
   but we still would still need split_at for locality
- fully adaptive algorithms (with worker and helper)
   a lot of design is still needed
- impl find first from existing iterators
- convenience functions like fusing slices...
- lots of benches
