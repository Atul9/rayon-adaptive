- get the work passing outputs around
- get back all basic schedulers
- get back sequential iterator on outputs
- derive for new Divisibility trait
- derive Edible (oh yeah!)
- all iterators adapters need to implement with_policy and blocks :-(
   -> derive it ?
- choose if divide needs a checked argument or not (and fix either range or slice)
- Edible's "iter" name is not well chosen
- into_par_iter and then rewrite doctests
