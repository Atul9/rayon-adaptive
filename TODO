- get back helper scheme
- choose if divide needs a checked argument or not (and fix either range or slice)
- local iterator extraction "iter" name is not well chosen
- collect trait
- iterator trait for blockedormore is not working
- if we use into_iter and then parallel reduction on each block then ByBlocks is asked twice for sizes
   is it a big deal ?
- switch to macros instead of deriving for IntoIter and ParallelIterator to avoid leaks ???
