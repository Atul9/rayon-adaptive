- new scheduling algorithm splitting recursively for locality
- stabilize api (do we need a 'split_at' ? rename Block to Input ? rename compute to work ?)
   it was nice to only need split (for .chars iterators for example)
   but we still would still need split_at for locality

   something like :
     - splittable
     - indexed_splittable (approximately)
     - input
   such that indexed_splittable : splittable
   and any indexed_splittable can be turned into a full input by adjunction of a work function


- fully adaptive algorithms (with worker and helper)
   a lot of design is still needed
- impl find first from existing iterators
- convenience functions like fusing slices...
- lots of benches
