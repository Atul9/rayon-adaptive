- get back helper scheme
- choose if divide needs a checked argument or not (and fix either range or slice)
- local iterator extraction "iter" name is not well chosen
- collect trait
- iterator trait for blockedormore is not working
- if we use into_iter and then parallel reduction on each block then ByBlocks is asked twice for sizes
   is it a big deal ?
- divide: shoud we divide something of size one ? what about flatmap ?
- what power do we have when we chain and how do we do it ?
- add unsafe to directly replace iterators when extracting ?
