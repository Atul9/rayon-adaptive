- fromrange : to_sequential is not that ok

- if we use into_iter and then parallel reduction on each block then ByBlocks is asked twice for sizes
   is it a big deal ?

- what power do we have when we chain and how do we do it ?
     ----> we can implement chain 3 times for each power level

- add unsafe to directly replace iterators when extracting ?
  -> it's not that easy. division is ok but we also need to move without dividing.
  (for example in blocks iterator when no sizes are left or in help when storing back in list)
  if iterators are bounded that's ok we could just divide at length but what if they are infinite ?

- can a Fn not implement Clone ? if so should we switch to Arc for sharing fn ?

- we can do Take like that:
   if indexed we change size
   if not indexed we cannot change size
   -> we need to parametrize take by the power or have several ones

- double check the divide_at(0) in help_work is not needed in help.rs even with special iterators like folders

- use the same trick as rayon to get our own Try and implement try_fold for our sequential iterators
