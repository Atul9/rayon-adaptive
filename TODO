- choose if divide needs a checked argument or not (and fix either range or slice)
     ----> I finally think the best choice is to check sizes inside the scheduler
- document how base_length works
     --> flatmap -> non-decreasing + if ask for more than lenght -> eat all
- add a final iterator extraction fn
- local iterator extraction "iter" name is not well chosen
- if we use into_iter and then parallel reduction on each block then ByBlocks is asked twice for sizes
   is it a big deal ?
- divide: shoud we divide something of size one ? what about flatmap ?
     ---> no. if flatmap has size one it contains no more recursive levels
- what power do we have when we chain and how do we do it ?
     ----> we can implement chain 3 times for each power level
- add unsafe to directly replace iterators when extracting ?
- can a Fn not implement Clone ? if so should we switch to Arc for sharing fn ?
- power iterator
